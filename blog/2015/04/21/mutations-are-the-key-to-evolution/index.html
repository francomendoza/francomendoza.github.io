			<p>Mutations are the key to evolution?</p>

<p>Definition: An immutable object is one whose state cannot be changed after it is created.</p>

<p><img src="~/dev/octopress/source/images/Example_1_2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>In the example 1 and 2 we modify the original object, Fixnum, and an Array, and the result is a new object.  This is evident through the change in #object_id.</p>

<p>Insert ex 3</p>

<p>In Example 3 we use a different method to add the string &ldquo;three&rdquo; to our Array: the &ldquo;shovel-method&rdquo;, otherwise known as #concat().  We would imagine a similar result as Example 2, as in, a new object would be returned.  Instead we see that the same object has been returned.  This means the object has been mutated.</p>

<p>The first conclusion we can draw is that Array&rsquo;s are mutable objects in Ruby.  Second, the mutation seems to occur with some methods (&lt;&lt;), but not with others (+=).</p>

<p>Perhaps the &ldquo;shovel-method&rdquo; mutates all objects?</p>

<p>insert ex 4</p>

<p>The answer is no.  Fixnums/Integers are immutable, and rightfully so.  A number is always going to be that number.  Think about a method mutates objects, such as any method that ends with a &ldquo;!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>insert ex 5</p>

<p>This would not make any sense, no method could ever change the value of 26 to 21.</p>

<p>Ok so why does any of this matter?</p>

<p>Something unusual about Ruby is that its String&rsquo;s are mutable, unlike most other popular OO languages (Python, Javascript, etc.).  This can cause problems if the developer is irresponsible with their Strings.  For example, a String as a key in a hash.</p>

<p>insert ex 6</p>

<p>This is why it is preferable to use Symbols as keys, as they are immutable.  Well what are some other benefits of immutability?</p>

<p>Readability:</p>

<p>insert ex 7</p>

<p>In Example 7 we see that there is some method that may possibly modify our array.  This may be a quick check now, but when you have many method calls within method calls, the uncertainty of your original array being the same will be unbearable!</p>

<p>So isn&rsquo;t immutable the way to go?  Well not necessarily&hellip; One major downfall is the amount of memory that would be used if all objects were immutable.  This is becoming a smaller concern where there are multiple core computers that can do parallel processing.  Regardless of which is better suited for your application, be careful with those mutations!</p>
