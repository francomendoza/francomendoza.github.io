			Enter the Graph</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A graph model can be used to explain many things including the structure of the internet, or the neural connections in your brain. Specifically, a graph is a set of nodes and edges/relationships between those nodes. The relationships between data are just as important as data itself. This cuts out the need for joins and join tables in the classic relational model because the data is already connected.</p>

<p>For example, if we wanted to create a database for storing artists, songs, and their genres where:
  1. Artists have many songs, and many genres through songs
  2. Songs have many genres
  3. Genres have many songs</p>

<p>A relational database would require four tables, including a &ldquo;join-table&rdquo; that would allow for a many to many relationship between songs and genres.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sql_tables.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>If you wanted to see what genres were associated to an artist, your query would look something like this&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/sql_query.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>So many joins.</p>

<p>In a graph database, each artist, song, and genre would be a separate node, and the relationships between them are already established.</p>

<p><img src="/images/graph.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Querying in graph databases is more about pattern matching&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/graph_query.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Graphs more intuitively describe the data, making querying much simpler to write. In addition, since data is already joined, queries are independent of dataset size and therefore faster.</p>

<p>Note: In this example, Cypher is being used as the querying language.  Cypher is used with the Neo4j database.</p>

<p>So why aren&rsquo;t graphs more popular in the wild?</p>

<p>Relational databases have been optimized and are much more reliable in many ways relative to NoSQL technologies.</p>

			Mutations Are the Key to Evolution?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Definition: An immutable object is one whose state cannot be changed after it is created.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Example_1_2.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>In the example 1 and 2 we modify the original object, Fixnum, and an Array, and the result is a new object.  This is evident through the change in #object_id.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Example_3.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>In Example 3 we use a different method to add the string &ldquo;three&rdquo; to our Array: the &ldquo;shovel-method&rdquo;, otherwise known as #concat().  We would imagine a similar result as Example 2, as in, a new object would be returned.  Instead we see that the same object has been returned.  This means the object has been mutated.</p>

<p>The first conclusion we can draw is that Array&rsquo;s are mutable objects in Ruby.  Second, the mutation seems to occur with some methods (&lt;&lt;), but not with others (+=).</p>

<p>Perhaps the &ldquo;shovel-method&rdquo; mutates all objects?</p>

<p><img src="/images/Example_4.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>The answer is no.  Fixnums/Integers are immutable, and rightfully so.  A number is always going to be that number.  Think about a method mutates objects, such as any method that ends with a &ldquo;!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/Example_5.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>This would not make any sense, no method could ever change the value of 26 to 21.</p>

<p>Ok so why does any of this matter?</p>

<p>Something unusual about Ruby is that its String&rsquo;s are mutable, unlike most other popular OO languages (Python, Javascript, etc.).  This can cause problems if the developer is irresponsible with their Strings.  For example, a String as a key in a hash.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Example_6.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>This is why it is preferable to use Symbols as keys, as they are immutable.  Well what are some other benefits of immutability?</p>

<p>Readability:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Example_7.png" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>In Example 7 we see that there is some method that may possibly modify our array.  This may be a quick check now, but when you have many method calls within method calls, the uncertainty of your original array being the same will be unbearable!</p>

<p>So isn&rsquo;t immutable the way to go?  Well not necessarily&hellip; One major downfall is the amount of memory that would be used if all objects were immutable.  This is becoming a smaller concern where there are multiple core computers that can do parallel processing.  Regardless of which is better suited for your application, be careful with those mutations!</p>

			On DNA and Programming Languages</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>How is programming similar to our biology?</p>

<p>People always refer to DNA as the code to life. Is this code similar to the code that we as programmers write everyday? In what ways is it different? Let&rsquo;s explore&hellip;</p>

<p>So how does DNA turn into cells, tissues, body parts, and life as we know it?</p>

<p>Transcription and Translation - Oversimplified&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://www.biologis.com/sites/default/files/Bild_24_0.jpg" alt="Alt text" /></p>

<p>Transcription is the process by which DNA is, in a sense, copied into RNA so it can be translated into polypetides. This may sound similar to code being translated into something the computer processor understands (machine lanuguage). This is not the case, DNA is translated because mRNA is smaller and it can leave the nucleus.</p>

<p>Translation is the process by which a ribosome takes mRNA and decodes it to create a polypeptide. These polypeptides have a wide variety of functions, performing duties as antibodies, enzymes, etc. These are the same enzymes that decoded the DNA in the first place!</p>

<p>A code that runs a function to decode itself?</p>

<p>In the end DNA is probably more similar to machine code&hellip;</p>
